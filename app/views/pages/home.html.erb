	<p>Note:  The first time you ask Kenobi to analyze questions for a user it's never been trained on before, you may be waiting a while. Please be patient, and don't close the tab until you see a flash at the top of the page indicating that it's done! </p>
	<p>After that initial set-up, you can use Kenobi to classify new Ask Metafilter questions for you whenever you want, without having to re-train Kenobi each time. Phew!</p>
