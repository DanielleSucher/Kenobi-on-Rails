	<p>Note:  If you've never used Kenobi before, you may be waiting a while. Sorry about that! Hang out and watch the spinny doodad, and you'll be redirected to your results just as soon as Kenobi has had the chance to figure you out.</p>
	<p>After that initial set-up, you can use Kenobi to classify new <%= link_to "AskMeFi", "http://ask.metafilter.com/" %> questions for you whenever you want, and it'll be much faster. Kenobi only goes through that long learning process the first time, or if it's been more than 6 months since the last time it updated its records on you. Phew!</p>
